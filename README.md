# RL Course Project at Emory BMI Fall 2024

This repository contains code implementation of the RL agent developed for the DBS synchrony suppression scenario and the VNS Cardiac Modulation scenario.
If running on Oddjobs, you need to work from the project environment created by the TA. 
Alternatively you can manually install the dependencies from the project.ipynb notebook folder that were created by the TA.  
To run the different scenarios, please use the following commands below. 

## DBS Synchrony Suppression
`python train_rl_dbs.py`

## VNS Cardiac Modulation
`python train_cardiac.py`

Here are the instructions originally shared by the TA to initially run the project notebooks that he created. 
## Lab Module
Use the `Lab_module_1.ipynb` under `notebooks` folder to get started.
## Project
Use the `project.ipynb` under `notebooks` folder to get started.
